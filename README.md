# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone, built to demonstrate front-end skills, using HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and AJAX, as well to demonstrate back-end skills, using Node and Express. 

Users can enter their tweet into the text field, and if the number of characters are within the character limit of 140, the tweet will be added below. If not within the character limits, an error message will appear. 

## Tweeter Features

*Tweets are listed with the most recent tweet at the top
*Users are alerted if they are not within the character limits, either 0 or over 140 characters
*The application has been formatted with responsive design for use on tablets and mobile devices
